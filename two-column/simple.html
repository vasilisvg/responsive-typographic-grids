	<h1>A simple responsive grid with a maximum of three columns</h1>
	<h2>The initial version</h2>
	<p>It's based on the simple rules about the ideal measure that can be found in <cite>The Elements Of Typographic Style</cite> by <b>Robert Bringhurst</b>. On page 26 he writes that the ideal measure is <em>anything between 45 and 75 characters</em>. For multicolumn text, which we don't have that much on the web, a measure between 40 and 50 characters is ok. In small and isolated patches of text a small measure of 12 or 15 characters can be used.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>These line lengths are in every case averages and they include empty spaces and punctuations as well as letters.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Translation</h2>
	<p>I translated this as follows: body-copy, or the main content as it is often called on the web, can be between 40 and 75 ems wide. Multicolumn layouts, often found on portals, can be between 40 and 50 characters wide. And secondary content, like sub navigations, asides and widgets, can be as small as 20 characters, with a max-width of 30. It should be noted that these are the widths of the actual content, white-space like margins, paddings and borders are not considered here. In these examples white-space is set to either 1 or 2 ems.</p>

	<h3>Side notes</h3>
	<p>The marginal notes that <b>Bringhurst</b> talks about are really too small for the web. 10 to 15 characters is unreadable. I decided side notes should be not more than 30 characters wide.</p>

	<h3>Hyphenation</h3>
	<p>If possible, turn on hyphenation. Definitely works in Firefox and Safari on iOs, not sure about other browsers. You should feature test it, you don't want to justify your text if it isn't available.</p>
